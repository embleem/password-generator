# Password Generator

## Description

This is a password generator. Input whether the user wants lower case, upper case, numbers, special characters and the length of password needed using prompts. With that information, and using a JavaScript algorithm, the password generator creates a random 'string' that can be used as a password. Highlight this password and copy it to be used in other applications.
